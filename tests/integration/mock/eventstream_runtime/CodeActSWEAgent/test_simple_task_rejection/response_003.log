I understand now that we are in an empty workspace and there is no git repository initialized. Since there's no git repository and no changes to commit, we can't write a commit message. Let's inform the user about this situation.

There is currently no git repository initialized in the workspace, and there are no files or changes to commit. Therefore, we cannot write a git commit message at this time. If you'd like to create a git repository and make some changes, we can do that and then write a commit message.
